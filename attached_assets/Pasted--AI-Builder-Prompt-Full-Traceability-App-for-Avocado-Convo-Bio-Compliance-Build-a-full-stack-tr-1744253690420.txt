✅ AI Builder Prompt – Full Traceability App for Avocado (Convo Bio Compliance)
Build a full-stack traceability web application for avocado production farms, compliant with Convo Bio standards. The app must allow daily tracking of the product lifecycle from harvest to client delivery, with barcode-based tracking and detailed PDF reports. Here are the requirements:

🧱 1. General Features:
Multi-farm management: Each farm has a name and unique code.

Daily product tracking: Each lot of avocado is tracked per day.

All stages must be logged: harvesting, packaging, cooling, shipping, delivery.

Web-based interface (mobile responsive).

Support for multiple users: farm operators, managers, and clients.

🧾 2. Data Entry Module:
Input form for:

Farm name (select or create new).

Lot number (auto-generated per day).

Date of operation.

Type of activity: harvest, cooling, shipping, delivery.

Quantity.

Operator name or ID.

Assign a unique barcode to each lot.

Upload option for additional files (e.g., certificates, temperature logs, etc.).

📦 3. Lot & Barcode Management:
Each lot must have:

Auto-generated barcode.

Printable label (PDF) with:

Farm info

Lot number

Barcode

Harvest date

Expiration date (optional)

Barcode scanner interface (webcam/mobile camera compatible).

📊 4. Traceability & Visualization:
Dashboard with filters:

By date

By farm

By lot

By delivery status

Each lot shows the full trace from start to finish:

Harvest → Cooling → Shipping → Client Delivery

📤 5. PDF Generator:
When a barcode is scanned, the system generates a downloadable PDF report showing:

Farm name & code

Full trace of the lot with dates

Quantity

All timestamps (harvest, cooled, shipped, received)

Optional signature of operator or delivery person

PDF should be clean, print-ready, and include the same barcode for visual confirmation.

🔐 6. Authentication & Access Control:
Admin panel (create/edit farms, manage users)

Farm operators: can input/edit data

Clients: can only scan barcode and see report

Secure login with roles

🛠️ 7. Tech Stack (Preferred):
Frontend: React / Vue (mobile responsive)

Backend: Node.js / Django / Firebase

Database: PostgreSQL / Firestore

Barcode Generator: Any standard JS or backend package

PDF Generator: Server-side (e.g., Puppeteer, wkhtmltopdf, or PDFKit)

Hosting: Cloud-ready (e.g., Vercel, Heroku, or Firebase Hosting)

🌐 Languages:
App in French or Moroccan Arabic (Darija) depending on user role

PDF export in French

✅ Final Goal:
End-to-end traceability system from farm to supermarket

Any client scanning a barcode gets a transparent product history in a clear PDF
